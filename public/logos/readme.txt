We don't have super thorough guidelines for these yet, but just try to keep within the same color family if you plan to alternate between showing icon and wordmark versions. 

For example, don't use the "colored icon with a dark background" for an avatar, and then show the "black wordmark with white background" in a header.

See the "families" image for how the logos are grouped.

Thanks!
